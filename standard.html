  <div class="post-date">09 August 2017</div>
  <p>I met Laura from <a href="http://foundation.travis-ci.org">Travis Foundation</a> a couple of years ago at a conference in Austria, and we had some good time and nice chats together. It’s not easy to keep always in touch with everyone you meet a conference, but thankfully Laura and I managed to cross paths mutliple times in the last few years. I was also delighted to work with her on bringing diversity tickets to Script’17. After attending Script’17, she asked me to write about my experiences in organizing and getting such a wonderful line-up on stage. Laura was super patient, as it took me about six months to finally get the piece done. But here it is, finally! Check out <a href="http://foundation.travis-ci.org/2017/08/09/not-so-hidden-figures/">Not so hidden figures - organizing ScriptConf</a> over at Travis Foundation!</p>

  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="/scriptcast/">My podcast journey to ScriptCast</a></h2>
  <div class="post-date">11 July 2017</div>
  <p>I love podcasting. I started back in 2009 and hosted a literature podcast for roughly two years. That’s where I made my first steps in producing non-written content and had lots of fun! I fiddled around doing interviews, chats, specials and audio dramas. Trying to read certain passages of books and added some sound effects to make those passages more interesting. Best thing was buying a semi-professional equipment and record public readings from authors directly from the mixer.</p>

  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="/grid-concepts/">Grid layout, grid layout everywhere!</a></h2>
  <div class="post-date">27 June 2017</div>
  <p>One of the great things about Microsoft Edge is that as a developer, you always know what to expect from an upcoming version. Communication is key! The <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/status/">platform status page</a> gives you a by feature list of the current development status, and the <a href="https://wpdev.uservoice.com/forums/257854-microsoft-edge-developer/suggestions/6514853-update-css-grid">Edge user voice</a> allows you to actively influence the developers’ backlog!</p>
  <p>I used this privilege to cast my three votes to the “Update CSS Grid” feature request. <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2012/3-114">IE 10 was one of the first browsers to implement the CSS Grid specification</a>. This specification comes from a time where Microsoft pushed the web platform hard to be a fully competitive platform for app development. And for that, it needed a proper layout mechanism. Hello, grid layouts! The original spec was pretty early and has been improved over the years. The new specification has reached candidate recommendation and has been since implement in … well, all major desktop browsers! The only one missing was Edge, until last week, when I got a notification from the Microsoft Edge Developer User Voice:</p>

  <div class="post-date">03 June 2017</div>
  <p>About two years ago, <a href="https://twitter.com/sebgie">Sebastian</a> and I had our first chats about having a JavaScript conference in our town of Linz. And this January, we made our vision reality and launched <a href="https://scriptconf.org">ScriptConf</a>, a conference about JavaScript. Giving it the (quite bold) tagline “The conference this city needs”, we wanted to make JavaScript more popular in Linz, while having a great time with an amazing community.</p>

  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="https://community.risingstack.com/the-definitive-guide-to-object-streams-in-node-js/">Object streams in Node.js</a></h2>
  <div class="post-date">19 April 2017</div>
  <p>I’m really good friends with the people at Rising Stack in Budapest. I had lots of fun when they invited me to JSConf Budapest back in May, and enjoy every time they show up here in Linz! I’m also looking forward to see them again when Peter will talk at the upcoming <a href="https://devone.at">Devone</a> conference. So it’s clear that I was more than eager to produce a guest post for their <a href="https://community.risingstack.com">Rising Stack community</a>. Even though I was so eager, it took me roughly 3 months to produce an article based on my recent book “Front-End tooling”. Nevertheless, I thought that my guide to object streams turned out pretty good! I hope <a href="https://community.risingstack.com/the-definitive-guide-to-object-streams-in-node-js/">you enjoy it</a>!</p>

  <div class="post-date">20 March 2017</div>
  <p>Back in the day I was an avid reader of <a href="https://the-pastry-box-project.net/">The pastry box</a>. You can imagine how super happy I was when Alex, the project’s creator asked me to contribute to his new project <a href="https://superyesmore.com/publication/the-human-in-the-machine-a4064599cde2cb3397239e8d72219f48">Human and the machine</a>. It’s all about productivity, in all shapes and forms imaginable. I wrote about “<a href="https://superyesmore.com/get-the-gist-8ff35dc28f30640e2d5fd54bcb7ff083">getting the gist</a>”, and how I manage to stay up to date without having to become an expert myself. Contributing was a wonderful experience, thanks again to Alex for having me and for this great opportunity!</p>

  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="https://www.spreaker.com/user/pureperformance/dynatrace-perform-2017-wednesday-highlig">I was a guest on the Perfbytes podcast</a></h2>
  <div class="post-date">22 February 2017</div>
  <p>The <a href="http://perfbytes.com">Perfbytes</a> crew was live at this year’s Perform conference, interviewing crew, attendees and speakers. I had the chance to have a few minutes with them talking about the <a href="https://www.dynatrace.com/capabilities/digital-experience-monitoring/visually-complete/">Visually Complete</a> metric and what it means for Real User Monitoring. Being a podcaster since 2009, it was funny for me doing an interview live from the other side of the microphone. But an experience I fully enjoyed, also mostly due to Mark’s excellent interviewing skills. I should do more live podcasts! If you like, give it a listen at <a href="https://www.spreaker.com/user/pureperformance/dynatrace-perform-2017-wednesday-highlig">Spreaker</a>. It’s a long show, my part starts roughly at 37 minutes. And keep in mind that I was super jetlagged. Thanks Mark and Brian for having me!</p>

  <div class="post-date">16 February 2017</div>
  <p>Sebastian and I gathered together a <a href="https://scriptconf.org/blog/script17-roundup">list of links and lots of coverage</a> to our
  conference we held in January. Lots of great blogs, podcasts, images and tweets,
  including a few words from our side. We had so much fun organising the conference
  and a wonderful time being there. Thanks to everybody for coming.</p>

  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="/real-user-visually-complete/">Real user speed index and visually complete</a></h2>
  <div class="post-date">07 February 2017</div>
  <p>This is a somewhat personal post today. I’m currently in Las Vegas (which would be a story on its own) to
  speak and attend our company’s <a href="https://www.dynatrace.com/perform">Perform conference</a>. Why me, as a mere
  web developer with no customer contact? First, I do like to bring the developer’s view into the whole mix.
  Second, I want to see the birth of a new product feature.</p>
